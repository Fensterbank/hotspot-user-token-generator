# hotspot-user-token-generator
Small solution I made for a specific wireless hotspot project to generate random passwords and print a user information page
Warning: Currently in development. PDF generation will come soon...

## Features
* Simple and fast one page app
* Generate Password
* Generate a PDF with information texts, current date and login information to print out for the user
* General pdf text content can be configured in config.json

## Lame
* Currently only in german language. You have to translate some code yourself

## Libraries
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [pdfmake](http://pdfmake.org/)
